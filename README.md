# Dynamic-Window-Approach
I am putting the code I have written for my thesis. As soon as I update the code I put the new one here.
Please check the 24.03.2020 version:
  - The Robot model is more robust now
  - Plotting the planned path is much faster than before
  - the code is more clear
  - the code is fully commented so by reading the code you can get the idea
